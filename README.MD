# Image Management Microservice

## What is it?

One of several microservices that will be connected together to create a backend for an Android/IOS app.

## Idea

A simple microservce that allows users to upload images and retrieve them.
Currently there is no database, but just a list that is managed and stored in memory.
This will all be wrapped in a docker container at some point, but for now it is plain python.
## SoonTM

List of features to come:

- Integrate with MongoDB
- Image Retrieval instead of just retrieving the image parameters as a json
- Docker Container
